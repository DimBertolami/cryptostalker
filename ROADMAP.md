_Local storage of API keys using Zustand store (useExchangeStore.ts)_
_Backend API for storing encrypted exchange configurations in Supabase_
**CCXT Integration (Phase 1):**
_Basic CCXT setup in the backend_
_Endpoints for listing exchanges (/api/ccxt/exchanges)_
_Testing exchange markets (/api/ccxt/test_exchange_markets)_
Basic Trading Infrastructure:

Frontend components for managing exchange connections
Price fetching services
What Needs to Be Implemented for Real-Time Live Trading
CCXT Integration (Phase 2):
API Key Management: Implement a secure system for storing and retrieving API keys. Currently, keys are stored in the frontend but need secure backend storage with encryption.
Balance Endpoint: Implement /api/ccxt/balance to retrieve real-time balances across exchanges.
Order Endpoints: Complete the implementation of /api/ccxt/create_order, /api/ccxt/open_orders, and /api/ccxt/cancel_order.
Error Handling: Add robust error handling for CCXT exceptions.
Automated Trading System:
Trading Strategy Engine: Create a system to define, store, and execute trading strategies.
Signal Generation: Implement algorithms to generate buy/sell signals based on market conditions.
Order Execution Logic: Develop logic to automatically execute trades when signals are triggered.
Position Management: Add functionality to manage open positions and track performance.
Real-Time Market Data:
WebSocket Integration: Implement WebSocket connections to exchanges for real-time price updates.
Price Alert System: Create a system to monitor price movements and trigger alerts or actions.
Order Book Analysis: Add functionality to analyze order books for better trade execution.
Risk Management:
Position Sizing: Implement algorithms to determine appropriate position sizes based on risk parameters.
Stop-Loss Management: Add automated stop-loss placement and management.
Portfolio Exposure Controls: Implement limits on total exposure to prevent overallocation.
Monitoring and Reporting:
Trade History: Create a system to record and display all executed trades.
Performance Metrics: Implement calculation of key performance indicators (ROI, win rate, etc.).
Notification System: Add alerts for trade executions, errors, and significant market events.
Testing Infrastructure:
Backtesting Framework: Develop a system to test strategies against historical data.
Paper Trading Mode: Implement a simulation mode that mimics real trading without actual execution.
Strategy Optimization: Add tools to optimize strategy parameters based on historical performance.
Multi-Exchange Support:
Exchange-Specific Adaptors: Extend beyond Bitvavo to fully support other exchanges like Binance.
Cross-Exchange Arbitrage: Implement functionality to identify and execute arbitrage opportunities.
User Configuration:
Strategy Parameters: Create UI for users to configure trading strategy parameters.
Risk Settings: Add controls for users to set risk tolerance and limits.
Trading Schedules: Implement functionality to set trading hours or conditions.
